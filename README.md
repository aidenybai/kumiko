# ðŸŒº Kumiko

### Beautiful no-class CSS library.

Writing CSS is annoying, especially when you want to build something _fast_. Tailwind tries to solve this by giving you classes, but we want to take it further. Kumiko aims to provide you prebuilt styles and a bit of custom elements, so you don't have to write CSS.
